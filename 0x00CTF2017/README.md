# 0x00CTF 2017 write ups

I had a break from work so i enjoyed this CTF! In the first 2 hours i focused on simple reverse engineering challanges, just for warm up :) 
Then i wanted to solve the hardest pwnable challenge of the competition, `left` challenge. Unfortunatly i pwned this service only few hours after the competition end, but i had really a lot of fun!

Find here my small write ups, thanks for the nice pwning weekend :P
